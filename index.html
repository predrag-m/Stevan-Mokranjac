    </p>

    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>He was born in <i>Negotin</i>. From the birthplace of his parents he drew the second last name Mokranjac
        (literally: <i>resident of Mokranje</i>).</p>

    <p>He graduated from the Belgrade high school, and attended the <i>natural science and mathematics</i> section of
        the <em><b>University of Belgrade</b></em>. In 1879 he traveled to <i>Munich</i> where he studied music in the class
        of Josef&nbsp;Rheinberger. After a brief break, he continued to study in <i>Rome</i> in the class of Parisotti, in
        1884. Returning to Serbia in 1884 he briefly became the conductor of the <ins>Kornelije Stanković choir of
        Belgrade</ins>.</p>

    <p>From 1885 to 1887 he studied music in <i>Leipzig, Germany</i>. Upon his return to Serbia in 1887 he became the
        conductor of the Belgrade singing society <em>(Belgrade Choir)</em>. From 1887 to 1900 he taught music at the Belgrade
        high school, and in 1901 transferred to Bogoslovija <em>(Belgrade Theological College)</em> where he taught church 
        singing. Together with <b>Stanislav Binički</b> and <b>Cvetko Manojlović</b>, Mokranjac founded the first independent
        music school in 1899 - <strong>Serbian Music School</strong> in <i>Belgrade</i>. He remains the director of this school 
        until his <i>death</i>. Today the school bears his name. His work as a melograph bore many transcriptions of thus far
        unwritten folk songs.</p>

    <p>Every year, the town of <em>Negotin</em> organizes a music festival in his honor called <strong><i>Mokranjčevi 
        dani</i></strong> <b>(Days of Mokranjac)</b>. The town also has a Mokranjac museum.</p>

    <h2>Works</h2>

    <p>His life was highly influenced by <mark>church</mark> and <mark>folk</mark> songs, and he used these two types of
        music as inspiration for his work. His most famous pieces are the <ins><em>fifteen Rukoveti</em></ins> 
        (Potpourri; literally: <i>"handfuls"</i> or <i>"bunches"</i>) - a collection of songs and music (orchestral suites) 
        based on motives of Serbian folk music from Bosnia&nbsp;and&nbsp;Herzegovina, Serbia Proper, Montenegro, 
        Kosovo&nbsp;and&nbsp;Metohija, Macedonia and Bulgaria. His other prominent folk-based works include <strong>Primorski 
        napjevi</strong> (Coastland tunes), and <strong>Kozar</strong>.<br>
        A significant number of his works were made for church services. Such as the <em>Božanstvena Liturgija Svetog Jovana 
        Zlatoustog</em> <i>(The Divine Liturgy of St. Chrysostom)</i>, from which the <em>Heruvimska pesma</em> 
        <i>(Cherubic hymn)</i> is most famous. Another two famous religious pieces are <em>Tebe Boga hvalim</em> <i>(Te Deum)</i> 
        and <em>Veličanije Sv. Savi</em> <i>(Megalynarion to St. Sava)</i>.</p>
